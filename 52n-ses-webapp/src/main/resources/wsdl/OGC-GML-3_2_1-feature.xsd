A GML feature is a (representation of a) identifiable real-world object in a selected domain of discourse. The feature schema provides a framework for the creation of GML features and feature collections.</documentation>

			<documentation>The basic feature model is given by the gml:AbstractFeatureType.
The content model for gml:AbstractFeatureType adds two specific properties suitable for geographic features to the content model defined in gml:AbstractGMLType. 
The value of the gml:boundedBy property describes an envelope that encloses the entire feature instance, and is primarily useful for supporting rapid searching for features that occur in a particular location. 
The value of the gml:location property describes the extent, position or relative location of the feature.</documentation>

			<documentation>This abstract element serves as the head of a substitution group which may contain any elements whose content model is derived from gml:AbstractFeatureType.  This may be used as a variable in the construction of content models.  
gml:AbstractFeature may be thought of as "anything that is a GML feature" and may be used to define variables or templates in which the value of a GML property is "any feature". This occurs in particular in a GML feature collection where the feature member properties contain one or multiple copies of gml:AbstractFeature respectively.</documentation>

Since gml:EnvelopeWithTimePeriod is assigned to the substitution group headed by gml:Envelope, it may be used whenever gml:Envelope is valid.</documentation>
