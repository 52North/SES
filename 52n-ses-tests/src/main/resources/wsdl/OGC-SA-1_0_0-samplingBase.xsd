Sampling features are feature types that are used primarily for making observations: 
Abstract SamplingFeature, and collections are described in this schema document

SamplingPoint, SamplingCurve, SamplingSurface and SamplingSolid are described in samplingManifold.xsd
Specimen and LocatedSpecimen are described in specimen.xsd

						<annotation>
							<documentation>A SamplingFeature is distinguished from typical domain feature types in that it has a set of [0..*] navigable associations with Observations, given the rolename relatedObservation. 
					This complements the association role “featureOfInterest” which is constrained to point back from the Observation to the Sampling-Feature. 
					The usual requirement of an Observation feature-of-interest is that its type has a property matching the observed-property on the Observation. 
					In the case of Sampling-features, the topology of the model and navigability of the relatedObservation role means that this requirement is satisfied automatically: 
					a property of the sampling-feature is implied by the observedProperty of a related observation. 
					This effectively provides an unlimited set of “soft-typed” properties on a Sampling Feature.</documentation>
