		<documentation>See ISO/DIS 19136 Clause 19.
A GML observation models the act of observing, often with a camera, a person or some form of instrument.  An observation feature describes the "metadata" associated with an information capture event, together with a value for the result of the observation.  This covers a broad range of cases, from a tourist photo (not the photo but the act of taking the photo), to images acquired by space borne sensors or the measurement of a temperature 5 meters below the surfaces of a lake.
The basic structures introduced in this schema are intended to serve as the foundation for more comprehensive schemas for scientific, technical and engineering measurement schemas.

			<documentation>The content model is a straightforward extension of gml:AbstractFeatureType; it automatically has the gml:identifier, gml:description, gml:descriptionReference, gml:name, and gml:boundedBy properties. 
The gml:validTime element describes the time of the observation. Note that this may be a time instant or a time period.
The gml:using property contains or references a description of a sensor, instrument or procedure used for the observation.
The gml:target property contains or references the specimen, region or station which is the object of the observation. This property is particularly useful for remote observations, such as photographs, where a generic location property might apply to the location of the camera or the location of the field of view, and thus may be ambiguous.  
The gml:subject element is provided as a convenient synonym for gml:target. This is the term commonly used in phtotography.  
The gml:resultOf property indicates the result of the observation.  The value may be inline, or a reference to a value elsewhere.
